How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
I managed to see it but with much of an effort.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
By comparing new versions with old one and seeing where the progress was made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?
I am in control, but I might be forgetful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because files might be dependent on each other.
